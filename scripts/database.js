Beanstox’s target market is this large population of over 100 million potential new investors, most of them middle income Americans. Beanstox successfully launched its app in March 2020 (soft launch) and an app redesign in February 2021, followed by increased client base growth.

After our successful launch of the Lucyd Lyte line in January 2021, we experienced significant interest from many eyewear retailers, so we are returning to StartEngine for help addressing our inventory needs, and to build the most complete line of smart eyewear on the market. Our mission is to Upgrade your Eyewear®. Consistent with this we are developing an exciting software app called Vyrb which will enable Lucyd Lyte users to hear and reply to social media posts with their voice, hands-free, through their glasses. We are planning to launch Vyrb this September for both iOS and Android as the first social app with a focus on wearables. Our smart eyewear acts like headphones and glasses in one, bringing vision correction and protection together with digital connectivity and clear audio, and offers a safer solution for listening to music outdoors compared to in-ear headphones.",
